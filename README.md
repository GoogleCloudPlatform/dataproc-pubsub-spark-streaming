In this tutorial you learn how to deploy an [Apache Spark](https://spark.apache.org/) streaming application on
[Cloud Dataproc](https://cloud.google.com/dataproc/) and process messages from [Cloud Pub/Sub](https://cloud.google.com/pubsub/)
in near real-time. The system you build in this scenario generates thousands of random tweets, identifies trending
hashtags over a sliding window, saves results in [Cloud Datastore](https://cloud.google.com/datastore/), and displays
the results on a web page.
